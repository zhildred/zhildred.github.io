    <h1>When to use classes or ids in HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p>
      In CSS we use things called selectors to target the style rules we write 
      to particular elements in HTML. We can target HTML tags like 
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> directly, but we 
      often want to only target a subset of elements that use a particular 
      HTML tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS there are two selectors that allow us to specify exactly which 
      HTML elements a ruleset will be applied to. These are the class and id 
      selectors. In HTML classes and ids are defined using the attributes 
      “class” and “id”, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;h2 class="sub-section" id="bio"&gt;Bio&lt;/h1&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In CSS a class selector is represented by a full stop “.”, while an id 
      selector is represented by a hashtag “#”, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        .sub-section {
          font-size: 14px;
        }

        #bio {
          color: red;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Classes and ids may seem alike at first, but are not. It is best 
      practice to use classes for rulesets that are (or might be) applied to 
      multiple elements, while ids should be used to apply rulesets that will 
      only ever be applied to a single specific element.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of reasons for this. In CSS both classes and ids are 
      treated identically, except that id selectors take precedence over class 
      selectors(both take precedence over element selectors). This is because 
      selectors that are more specific take precedence over those that are 
      more general, and as id should only be applied to a single element it is 
      the most specific of all. This allows us to ensure that the rules we 
      write specifically for this element will always override conflicting 
      rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML there are restrictions on the use of the id attribute that 
      ensure that a particular id can only be attached to a single element. An 
      element can have as many classes as we like, but it can only have one 
      id. Classes can be used as many times as we like on one page, but each 
      id can only be used once in a particular HTML document. This prevents us 
      from accidentally creating duplicate ids.
    </p>

    <p>
      One special function of ids is that they can be used in a URL to 
      automatically scroll the page to a particular element when it is loaded. 
      If you have ever seen a URL like: EXAMPLE, this is how they work. Ids 
      also play an important role in javascript, where the function 
      GetElementByID can be used to manipulate a specific element.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while classes and ids are extremely useful, the best practice of all 
      is to avoid using them if it is possible to without making your HTML 
      confusing, for example instead of:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;div class="heading"&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      You should try use an equivelant HTML tag like:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;header&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
  </Body>
